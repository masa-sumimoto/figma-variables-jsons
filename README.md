# figma-variables-jsons

My original JSON files used when utilizing the Variables feature announced by Figma at Config 2023.

In Figma, We can import and export sets of variables by [using the official sample plugin](https://github.com/figma/plugin-samples/tree/master/variables-import-export).

For importing into Figma, you can gather your own color sets, margin definitions, and other relevant information in JSON format.
